Color Sorter Using Pneumatic System with Arduino Nano
This project is a color sorter that uses a TCS3200 color sensor to detect colors and a pneumatic system to sort objects based on their color. The system is controlled by an Arduino Nano, which processes the color data and activates solenoids to operate the pneumatic cylinders for sorting. This project is ideal for applications like industrial automation, robotics, and educational demonstrations.

Components Used
Arduino Nano: Microcontroller to control the system.

TCS3200 Color Sensor: Detects colors (red, green, blue, and white).

Pneumatic Cylinders: Used for sorting objects based on color.

Solenoids: Control the pneumatic cylinders.

DC Motor: Used for conveyor belt movement (optional, depending on setup).

Potentiometer: Adjusts the motor speed (optional).

Breadboard and Jumper Wires: For connections.

Power Supply: To power the Arduino, motor, and solenoids.

Circuit Diagram
Below is the pin configuration for the project:

Component	Arduino Nano Pin
TCS3200 S0	D9
TCS3200 S1	D8
TCS3200 S2	D11
TCS3200 S3	D10
TCS3200 OUT	D12
Motor IN1	D4
Motor IN2	D7
Motor ENA (PWM)	D3
Potentiometer	A1
Solenoid 1	D6
Solenoid 2	D5
How It Works
Color Detection:

The TCS3200 sensor reads color values (red, green, blue, and white) and sends them to the Arduino Nano.

The Arduino processes these values to determine the detected color.

Pneumatic Sorting:

Depending on the detected color, the Arduino activates the appropriate solenoid to control the pneumatic cylinder.

The pneumatic cylinder pushes or pulls to sort the object into the correct bin.

Motor Control (Optional):

If a conveyor belt is used, the motor speed can be adjusted using a potentiometer.

The motor direction is set to forward by default.

Color-Based Actions:

The system performs specific actions based on the detected color:

Blue: Activates Solenoid 1 to sort blue objects.

Red: Activates Solenoid 2 to sort red objects.

Green: Activates both solenoids for green objects.

Yellow: Delays sorting for yellow objects.

White: Stops the system for white objects.

Code Structure
Setup Function:

Initializes the pins for solenoids, motor control, and serial communication.

Loop Function:

Continuously reads color values from the TCS3200 sensor.

Adjusts the motor speed based on the potentiometer input (if used).

Activates the solenoids based on the detected color.

Motor Control Function:

Sets the motor direction and speed based on the potentiometer input.

Solenoid Control Function:

Controls the solenoids to operate the pneumatic cylinders for sorting.

Installation
Arduino IDE: Ensure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer.

TCS3200 Library: Install the TCS3200 library in the Arduino IDE.

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries, search for TCS3200, and install it.

Upload the Code:

Connect your Arduino Nano to your computer.

Select the correct board (Arduino Nano) and port in the Arduino IDE.

Upload the code to the Arduino.

Usage
Power Up: Connect the Arduino Nano to a power source.

Adjust Potentiometer (if used): Rotate the potentiometer to adjust the motor speed.

Color Detection: Place the TCS3200 sensor near the object whose color you want to detect.

Observe Sorting: The pneumatic system will sort the objects based on the detected color.

Troubleshooting
Motor Not Running: Check the motor connections and ensure the potentiometer is properly connected.

Incorrect Color Detection: Ensure the TCS3200 sensor is properly calibrated and the object is well-lit.

Solenoids Not Activating: Verify the solenoid connections and ensure the power supply is sufficient.

Pneumatic Cylinders Not Moving: Check the air pressure and connections to the cylinders.
